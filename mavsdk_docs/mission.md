    Generated by dcsdkgen - MAVSDK Mission API

    *async* cancel\_mission\_download()[¶](#mavsdk.mission.Mission.cancel_mission_download "Link to this definition")
    :   Cancel an ongoing mission download.

        Raises:
        :   [**MissionError**](#mavsdk.mission.MissionError "mavsdk.mission.MissionError") – If the request fails. The error contains the reason for the failure.

    *async* cancel\_mission\_upload()[¶](#mavsdk.mission.Mission.cancel_mission_upload "Link to this definition")
    :   Cancel an ongoing mission upload.

        Raises:
        :   [**MissionError**](#mavsdk.mission.MissionError "mavsdk.mission.MissionError") – If the request fails. The error contains the reason for the failure.

    *async* clear\_mission()[¶](#mavsdk.mission.Mission.clear_mission "Link to this definition")
    :   Clear the mission saved on the vehicle.

        Raises:
        :   [**MissionError**](#mavsdk.mission.MissionError "mavsdk.mission.MissionError") – If the request fails. The error contains the reason for the failure.

    *async* download\_mission()[¶](#mavsdk.mission.Mission.download_mission "Link to this definition")
    :   Download a list of mission items from the system (asynchronous).

        Will fail if any of the downloaded mission items are not supported
        by the MAVSDK API.

        Returns:
        :   **mission\_plan** – The mission plan

        Return type:
        :   [MissionPlan](#mavsdk.mission.MissionPlan "mavsdk.mission.MissionPlan")

        Raises:
        :   [**MissionError**](#mavsdk.mission.MissionError "mavsdk.mission.MissionError") – If the request fails. The error contains the reason for the failure.

    *async* download\_mission\_with\_progress()[¶](#mavsdk.mission.Mission.download_mission_with_progress "Link to this definition")
    :   Download a list of mission items from the system (asynchronous) and report progress.

        Will fail if any of the downloaded mission items are not supported
        by the MAVSDK API.

        Yields:
        :   **progress\_data** (*ProgressDataOrMission*) – The progress data, or the mission plan (when the download is finished)

        Raises:
        :   [**MissionError**](#mavsdk.mission.MissionError "mavsdk.mission.MissionError") – If the request fails. The error contains the reason for the failure.

    *async* get\_return\_to\_launch\_after\_mission()[¶](#mavsdk.mission.Mission.get_return_to_launch_after_mission "Link to this definition")
    :   Get whether to trigger Return-to-Launch (RTL) after mission is complete.

        Before getting this option, it needs to be set, or a mission
        needs to be downloaded.

        Returns:
        :   **enable** – If true, trigger an RTL at the end of the mission

        Return type:
        :   bool

        Raises:
        :   [**MissionError**](#mavsdk.mission.MissionError "mavsdk.mission.MissionError") – If the request fails. The error contains the reason for the failure.

    *async* is\_mission\_finished()[¶](#mavsdk.mission.Mission.is_mission_finished "Link to this definition")
    :   Check if the mission has been finished.

        Returns:
        :   **is\_finished** – True if the mission is finished and the last mission item has been reached

        Return type:
        :   bool

        Raises:
        :   [**MissionError**](#mavsdk.mission.MissionError "mavsdk.mission.MissionError") – If the request fails. The error contains the reason for the failure.

    *async* mission\_progress()[¶](#mavsdk.mission.Mission.mission_progress "Link to this definition")

        Yields:
        :   **mission\_progress** (*MissionProgress*) – Mission progress

    name *= 'Mission'*[¶](#mavsdk.mission.Mission.name "Link to this definition")

    *async* pause\_mission()[¶](#mavsdk.mission.Mission.pause_mission "Link to this definition")
    :   Pause the mission.

        Pausing the mission puts the vehicle into
        [HOLD mode](<https://docs.px4.io/en/flight_modes/hold.html>).
        A multicopter should just hover at the spot while a fixedwing vehicle should loiter
        around the location where it paused.

        Raises:
        :   [**MissionError**](#mavsdk.mission.MissionError "mavsdk.mission.MissionError") – If the request fails. The error contains the reason for the failure.

    *async* set\_current\_mission\_item(*index*)[¶](#mavsdk.mission.Mission.set_current_mission_item "Link to this definition")
    :   Sets the mission item index to go to.

        By setting the current index to 0, the mission is restarted from the beginning. If it is set
        to a specific index of a mission item, the mission will be set to this item.

        Note that this is not necessarily true for general missions using MAVLink if loop counters
        are used.

        Parameters:
        :   **index** (*int32\_t*) – Index of the mission item to be set as the next one (0-based)

        Raises:
        :   [**MissionError**](#mavsdk.mission.MissionError "mavsdk.mission.MissionError") – If the request fails. The error contains the reason for the failure.

    *async* set\_return\_to\_launch\_after\_mission(*enable*)[¶](#mavsdk.mission.Mission.set_return_to_launch_after_mission "Link to this definition")
    :   Set whether to trigger Return-to-Launch (RTL) after the mission is complete.

        This will only take effect for the next mission upload, meaning that
        the mission may have to be uploaded again.

        Parameters:
        :   **enable** (*bool*) – If true, trigger an RTL at the end of the mission

        Raises:
        :   [**MissionError**](#mavsdk.mission.MissionError "mavsdk.mission.MissionError") – If the request fails. The error contains the reason for the failure.

    *async* start\_mission()[¶](#mavsdk.mission.Mission.start_mission "Link to this definition")
    :   Start the mission.

        A mission must be uploaded to the vehicle before this can be called.

        Raises:
        :   [**MissionError**](#mavsdk.mission.MissionError "mavsdk.mission.MissionError") – If the request fails. The error contains the reason for the failure.

    *async* upload\_mission(*mission\_plan*)[¶](#mavsdk.mission.Mission.upload_mission "Link to this definition")
    :   Upload a list of mission items to the system.

        The mission items are uploaded to a drone. Once uploaded the mission can be started and
        executed even if the connection is lost.

        Parameters:
        :   **mission\_plan** ([*MissionPlan*](#mavsdk.mission.MissionPlan "mavsdk.mission.MissionPlan")) – The mission plan

        Raises:
        :   [**MissionError**](#mavsdk.mission.MissionError "mavsdk.mission.MissionError") – If the request fails. The error contains the reason for the failure.

    *async* upload\_mission\_with\_progress(*mission\_plan*)[¶](#mavsdk.mission.Mission.upload_mission_with_progress "Link to this definition")
    :   Upload a list of mission items to the system and report upload progress.

        The mission items are uploaded to a drone. Once uploaded the mission can be started and
        executed even if the connection is lost.
