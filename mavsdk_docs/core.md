# Core[¶](#module-mavsdk.core "Link to this heading")

*class* mavsdk.core.ConnectionState(*is\_connected*)[¶](#mavsdk.core.ConnectionState "Link to this definition")
:   Bases: `object`

    Connection state type.

    Parameters:
    :   **is\_connected** (*bool*) – Whether the vehicle got connected or disconnected

*class* mavsdk.core.Core(*async\_plugin\_manager*)[¶](#mavsdk.core.Core "Link to this definition")
:   Bases: `AsyncBase`

    Access to the connection state and core configurations

    Generated by dcsdkgen - MAVSDK Core API

    *async* connection\_state()[¶](#mavsdk.core.Core.connection_state "Link to this definition")
    :   Subscribe to ‘connection state’ updates.

        Yields:
        :   **connection\_state** (*ConnectionState*) – Connection state

    name *= 'Core'*[¶](#mavsdk.core.Core.name "Link to this definition")

    *async* set\_mavlink\_timeout(*timeout\_s*)[¶](#mavsdk.core.Core.set_mavlink_timeout "Link to this definition")
    :   Set timeout of MAVLink transfers.

        The default timeout used is generally (0.5 seconds) seconds.
        If MAVSDK is used on the same host this timeout can be reduced, while
        if MAVSDK has to communicate over links with high latency it might
        need to be increased to prevent timeouts.

        Parameters:
        :   **timeout\_s** (*double*) – Timeout in seconds
