# Action[¶](#action "Link to this heading")

*class* mavsdk.action.Action(*async\_plugin\_manager*)[¶](#mavsdk.action.Action "Link to this definition")
:   Bases: `AsyncBase`

    Enable simple actions such as arming, taking off, and landing.

    Generated by dcsdkgen - MAVSDK Action API

    *async* arm()[¶](#mavsdk.action.Action.arm "Link to this definition")
    :   Send command to arm the drone.

        Arming a drone normally causes motors to spin at idle.
        Before arming take all safety precautions and stand clear of the drone!

        Raises:
        :   [**ActionError**](#mavsdk.action.ActionError "mavsdk.action.ActionError") – If the request fails. The error contains the reason for the failure.

    *async* arm\_force()[¶](#mavsdk.action.Action.arm_force "Link to this definition")
    :   Send command to force-arm the drone without any checks.

        Attention: this is not to be used for normal flying but only bench tests!

        Arming a drone normally causes motors to spin at idle.
        Before arming take all safety precautions and stand clear of the drone!

        Raises:
        :   [**ActionError**](#mavsdk.action.ActionError "mavsdk.action.ActionError") – If the request fails. The error contains the reason for the failure.

    *async* disarm()[¶](#mavsdk.action.Action.disarm "Link to this definition")
    :   Send command to disarm the drone.

        This will disarm a drone that considers itself landed. If flying, the drone should
        reject the disarm command. Disarming means that all motors will stop.

        Raises:
        :   [**ActionError**](#mavsdk.action.ActionError "mavsdk.action.ActionError") – If the request fails. The error contains the reason for the failure.

    *async* return\_to\_launch()[¶](#mavsdk.action.Action.return_to_launch "Link to this definition")
    :   Send command to return to the launch (takeoff) position and land.

        This switches the drone into [Return mode](<https://docs.px4.io/master/en/flight_modes/return.html>) which
        generally means it will rise up to a certain altitude to clear any obstacles before heading
        back to the launch (takeoff) position and land there.

        Raises:
        :   [**ActionError**](#mavsdk.action.ActionError "mavsdk.action.ActionError") – If the request fails. The error contains the reason for the failure.

        Parameters:
        :   **speed\_m\_s** (*float*) – Speed in meters/second

        Raises:
        :   [**ActionError**](#mavsdk.action.ActionError "mavsdk.action.ActionError") – If the request fails. The error contains the reason for the failure.

    :   Send command to shut down the drone components.

        This will shut down the autopilot, onboard computer, camera and gimbal.
        This command should only be used when the autopilot is disarmed and autopilots commonly
        reject it if they are not already ready to shut down.

        Raises:
        :   [**ActionError**](#mavsdk.action.ActionError "mavsdk.action.ActionError") – If the request fails. The error contains the reason for the failure.

    :   Send command to transition the drone to fixedwing.

        The associated action will only be executed for VTOL vehicles (on other vehicle types the
        command will fail). The command will succeed if called when the vehicle
        is already in fixedwing mode.

        Raises:
        :   [**ActionError**](#mavsdk.action.ActionError "mavsdk.action.ActionError") – If the request fails. The error contains the reason for the failure.
